(if you send any requests with the Accept header set to "application/json", it will also return the JSON data for that endpoint)<br/>
for now, you can use the [beta site](https://beta.wasteof.money) itself to send and use endpoints

~~NOTE: you can't use any of these endpoints if you weren't invited to the wasteof3 beta~~<br/>
ignore the message above. you can only use the endpoints IF the requests have a `cookie` header that have a `wasteofbeta` key with the value of your wasteof3 beta password. (https://wasteof.money/posts/6287debfc84fe3bebc2c64a7#comments-6287fe73c137a2e8af01b58a)
