(if you send any requests with the Accept header set to "application/json", it will also return the JSON data for that endpoint)<br/>
for now, you can use the [beta site](https://beta.wasteof.money) itself to send and use endpoints

you can use the wasteof3 api with or without beta access as the beta is public. keep in mind that [the beta api is subject to change and was designed for internal use](https://wasteof.money/posts/629eef086586aae544597fac)

# wasteof3-docs
